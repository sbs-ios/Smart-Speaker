# Smart-Speaker
It's an upgraded regular speaker (sound amplifier)  with Arduino Uno and Esp8266 as a Wi-Fi adapter, WS2812b LED strip, and a sound level sensor.

## This smart speaker has the following capabilities:

 - It can also be controlled remotely via WIFI using any type of smartphone or computer with Wi-Fi capabilities and an internet browser.
 - It can also be controlled by multiple users via different devices simultaneously. 
 - The controlling process includes changing brightness, color, or auto-switching patterns with beautiful patterns, live and without lags.
 - The best part about the project is the ability to interact with the music or the surrounding sound automatically using the low-loud sound sensor by sensing the sound and auto-switch between patterns, which gives a real-time visualization of music.

## Working on updates: 
Adding speaking in English abilities using multiple Arduino TTS libraries, it's a voice synthesizer that converts a stream of digital text into retro (robot) speech. Also, I am planning to make it possible to control it via the internet.


## Important notes :
- This is a very early version of the project as it might contain some bugs .
- The part of the code responsible for the ability to interact with the music or the surrounding sound automatically using the low-loud sound sensor is NOT included in the code, as its still in an early phases of development and its full of bugs that's causing a big time failures. But it will be added soon once its functions with a good level of efficacy.
